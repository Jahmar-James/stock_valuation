    DatabaseInspector: A utility class to aid in inspecting database details, structures, and values.

    This class is primarily designed for:
    1. Checking the existence of specific entries.
    2. Retrieving metadata such as the columns of a specific model.
    3. Using aggregate functions for specific analysis, like `array_agg`, `min`, etc.
    4. Retrieving entries based on conditions.
    5. Retrieving paginated entries.

    Note: This class does not mutate the database; it's mainly for retrieval and inspection purposes.
